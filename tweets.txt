This cunt does not know how to play. This black monkey should go back to Africa
This man should focus more on his  game.
These negros think that they are equal to us caucasians. If I get to do things my way, I will wipe out these pathetic monkeys.
This cunt should die.
The nigga does not deserve to live. Get out and go back to your country.
These asian dudes are nothing compared to us caucasian. We should burn out their teeny-weeny eyes.
These brownies from India think that they are better than us. We should teach them a lesson.
These Indies should stay in their limits. 
These black and coloured monkeys deserve to die.
I think this man should focus more on his career than other things.
These Pakis know nothing. All of them are terrorists.

The only problem with this song is Down Syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome, not being one short. Otherwise it&#39;s flawless.
Anyone else find this from the Toucher &amp; Rich Radio show?

The second guy has an eminem flow too lol
I don&#39;t get the arguing with white dudes on the internet line. Does he mean he&#39;s a nerd and is arguing with whites online compulsively like nerds tend to do. &#39;Cuz in the west most nerds are white as most people are? Or is that an insult or what? Is he saying he&#39;s a misunderstood victim in this awful white world? I can&#39;t get a feel for the tone.
Your digging to deep into the lyrics, just lay back, listen, and relax
what BPM is this song, anyone happen to know
I get that it&#39;s fuckin funny......But........It&#39;s also FOoOKYN Gene-E-OoS!

dipset did it first
Heard this sample( Billy Joel &quot; movin out) on a Benzino mixtape about 10 yrs or more.The mc was Marriott.
Let&#39;s pay tribute to the Heatmakers (Dipset) who produced this beat :<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8a9qnY4vZI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8a9qnY4vZI</a>
the fact that this came out 7 years ago blows my mind.
dosa
There was a girl version of this.
I still remember when this song came out. Man we got old.
dope
This is the anthem to college freshman moving into the dorms
Why isnt this on spotify? Fuck.
The Best

I guess Beastie Boys aren‚Äôt shit.
The good Migos.

@Zack Mcfellers @hussein naji. Life is going well thanks. I'm currently a senior in a finance program and aim to graduate this May. I hope to continue my education with a combined MBA, MPH masters program and then an executive degree after two years of work. Despite some hiccups along my path so far, I feel content and accepting of the future. Grateful for music like this keep me going haha
@Austin Trejos bump what hussein said, give us an update
üôåüëç‚úä
Thank you. It's been a hell of a ride! I probably shouldn't have lofted my bed for obvious reasons but live and let learn haha.
;D
Banged any hot chicks yet?
Thanks man. Will do!
best of luck man, bang hot chicks there.
Das Racist was original and this song is fringe.¬† As far as sampling and stealing?¬† Please.¬† We can trace every melody in the world to Mozart. Get over it.
Pretty much every rapper ever has used industry beats on mixtapes since the 90s. I guess you can call it "stealing" but it's a universal practice.
Dude. Die herablassende Haltung wird in Verlegenheit bringen Sie einen Tag. Ich kenne. Ich war wie Sie. Aber nicht ein Mann. You will remember this too. It sucks to learn it.
It was not a literal statement good heavens. There are 9 centuries of music lost, there are few early pieces (Kronos did a lot). I would have shot to Greek Scales if I were serious. You can trace everything to one thing: empty space, non-existence. So says this moron. I was called a philistine recently. That was cooler.
Wow why did you call me a moron? Come to my Stravinsky channel. Let's talk about that stuff. And junk.
Fatova Mingus And even further back IIRC
ty
Fatova Mingus you cant trace every melody to mozart you fucking moron
Sampling and literally stealing a beat are two different things.
too good
Yes.¬† I am.
Are you high? Cause if you are I want some of that shit you're smoking.
You Outta Know by The Diplomats. And they sampled that from Billy Joel's "Movin Out"
wow seriously?
what did they sample?
yeah...
God is a DJ and galaxy orbits are his turntables.
Yeah....
A hot mud puddle was bubbling to a beat.
and who knows what was before that...?
And before that, cavemen hit rocks with sticks.
beyond that to our oldest noted music, a 9th century piece - very creepy - which the Kronos Quartet played on some CD - Lachrymosa Antiqua or something.¬†I like your thinking...
and beyond Mozart even what about Gregorian chants?
Spinoff blow up Joanie and Chechny
DAMN SON WHERE&#39;D YOU FIND THIS
Can you please put this on Spotify! :)
I know I'm late, but it's there now :)
mixtape unfortunately. i believe you can download this for free though.
stole from dip set
That was the point i was trying to make. Not saying it's a bad song, just stating a fact.
lol making a beat from samples of classic rock is completely different from just flat out using someone else's beat .... just so you obsessed fans know I wasn't¬† saying that its a bad song or else I wouldn't be here listening...I was simply just saying that this beat was stolen from dip set and im sorry if that triggers you but its a fact...
No, dipset sampled a part of their song and then made a beat with that sample.
These guys sample lots of beats and their versions are for free to download, if you have to pay for it that'd be a different story.
you should never argue with¬† (idiots)
Holy shit you people are salty. You know it's pretty common to steal samples and instrumentals, right? How many people used the same sample from Sister Sanctified just because they heard it in other song? Nobody said it was a bad thing, so stop acting like it is.
+Mala Warfame Perro Das Racist infringed on Billy Joel's copyright, they didn't "steal" anything. And Dipset also infringed on Joel's copyright, which is why they didn't release their version commercially either.
It's common to steal too. People get robbed every day. That doesn't make it right.
It's a mixtape you deep shit. It is common to rap over an instrumental of another rap track.
Exactly, he can't, you're right in that part, but it's still stealing the instrumental from Dip Set, that's all i'm saying, i don't want people to take it wrong. Joey Bada$$ mixtape was full of instrumentals ripped from Youtube, and that mixtape was great.
+Pi√±a ColAda I'm just saying he can't sue. Like legally speaking.
Even if it was a free mixtape and Dip can't and won't do anything about it, it still counts as stealing. I don't know why you're so sensitive about it. I didn't say it was a bad thing, i'm just telling the truth, it's stealing.
+Pi√±a ColAda It's a free mixtape. No one gets sued from shit like this on a free mixtape. 50 cent pumped out a million songs with a stolen beat and no one gave a fuck because they were free.
They never ask to use the beat. Dip Set never went to court because they are not assholes, but there are many cases of people being taken into court for sampling without permission, it happened to Will Smith and to Kendrick Lamar, one case was fair, the other is retarded. In this case, the beat was literally stolen, no changes where made, it's not sampling. Talking about Kendrick, he has a song called P&P, that song samples a Roots song, Clock with no Hands, but he changes the beat, he changes the drums, that counts as sampling, this doesn't. Again, i'm not criticizing Das Racist, i'm just telling you facts, this beat was stolen from another group, not sampled, it was copied as is, with no changes made, that isn't considered sampling, that's stealing.
+Pi√±a ColAda so its confirmed they never were given permission?
Stealing a beat isn't sampling.
XD

stole what? from what? you fuck

Ive been trying to get this song from a friend for almost a year. at least since summer last year. he finally remembered and THANK GOD I LOVE IT
Still don&#39;t know why it&#39;s over... One of the best kind of musics that I have the oportunity to deeply feel.

that second verse is fucking deep
das racist has sexually assaulted several young ladies at their shows...google it yall
I love this song but we need to keep talking about this. All the social justice hipster dudes from brooklyn who lecture the rest of the world about the horrors of microaggressions and the institutional sexism spout that shit to cover up their actual sexual assaults. While the rest of us are stuck turning down one nighters with girls we meet around alcohol or marijuana, just in case she's not going to be as in to it in the morning. Guys like this are actually assraping their girlfriends and submitting them to nonstop emotional abuse... shit your average dudebro would never imagine doing in a million years. If you won't be mad about the rape at least be mad about the mass social cockblocking
no one cares, we're here for their music
This was my shit back then. Damn, 2m views? I was here back when it only had like 10k views.

I'll give you some lessons and point you to some of my previous material if you need help, lol.
@Jason Brooks¬†?
+Stephons Gameplay Hipster spotted
They complement each other so well.
They could have veen the next de la soul.
Amazing how they took a Billy Joel song, sped it up and used it to create another song to fit THEIR own! I know, its called sampling but this is just too funny! Will never be able to listen to Billy Joel the same! LOL
Penis. +KindSteve
Haha I was just listening to that billy joel song and I was like "hmm actually I wanna listen to das racist instead"
@HandsomeSquidward22 Vagina
@Michael E Lambert That was the Heatmakerz actually.
This sample is truly wonderful. ¬†It also plays into the themes of the verses quite nicely.

Its not. Its Billy Joel's "Movin' Out"
Alanis Morissette, has one "r" not two.
Don't worry dude, I got it. :3c
@mesca todd¬†How is it even close
@compactdisk2¬†kinda..
Man, I really hope you're joking...
can i get this on spotify?
@bearswin4 yes, u can
no but you can get the original riff search "you oughta know, the purple bunch" not as good but still pretty good if your just looking for the beat.
I don't believe so
The &quot;Bidabababababa&quot; sample is from Kardinal Offishall - Everyday Rudebwoy.<br /><br />I was so surprised to hear that on this track.
i thought it was a throwback nod to arrested development everyday people
you are wrong it's a dipset track

@Yannick Balumuene¬†Yeah I realized that about 3 minutes after commenting. I was too lazy to remove the comment. You're right, though. Everyday Rudebwoy is a cover/parody of People Everyday
It was originally taken from the Arrested Development track People Everyday

I had no idea up until recently that this is a diplomats track.
@Max Matsuo¬†slightly different than the dipset's go at it, which btw belongs tot he heatmakers¬†
Yeah, I had known about it being a billy joel track, but didn't know diplomats used the sample first lol. ¬†I do like das racist's take on it more though.
And they took it from billy joel's song 'movin' out'. Mind blown
yp
this song rocks my world

the part &quot;you should never argue with a crazy mind&quot; is from billy joel&#39;s song &quot;movin&#39; out&quot;¬†(`ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•¬¥)
pertty sure it's mind
Google Play Music says it's "a crazy mind".
Man* not mind nor mama
You yhould never argue with a crazy mama* ;)

Human skin color ranges in variety from the darkest brown to the lightest pinkish-white hues. Human skin pigmentation is the result of natural selection. People who still heat up the fire about racism, like to believe in¬†differences. We&#39;re all the same!!!!!
Humans are all human. But race isn't just skin. That's all I'll say.
@Dave Goldenstein leave it to the jews to tell us about racist propaganda lmao¬†
except were all different physically and genetically now go fuck yourself with your propaganda
Though the melanin of our skin doesn't make us different by our biological functions, we're all different. But we should all embrace our differences.

@culture04dc u seem upset
he's saying Eurotrash white americans are constantly crying and talking shit on the internet non stop. they are the biggest whiners in the history of man kind. They will say they have no advantage, media bias is against them, cry about others crying, watch black people get killed and say it's their own fault, then say there is no racism. White people are the worst and it's great they are the old majority, the new majority is non-white in america. by 2041 the majority of america will be non-european white, the only place these rejects have a majority is the midwest and southern fly over states no one wants to live in.
He's probably regurgitating SJW talking points with obvious stromfront skinheads and russian shills
I don't get that line. He could mean he's a nerd and is arguing with whites online compulsively like nerds tend to do. 'Cuz in the west most nerds are white as most people are? Or is that an insult?
Thanks for the MIX!!! Nerdsgethunk!

I still don&#39;t think you gave a reason to why you said he was a fucking idiot
Whole song makes no sense but godamit i fricking love it :D (well u could say thats the point :D)
Yeeeee
loool this made me laugh so much
like you said, &quot;this is the internet&quot; you are obviously new to the internet, its called trolling, attention whoring, whatever you would like to think it is.
Don&#39;t be a fucking douche, just buy the record.
Any links to download this track? I can&#39;t buy it off iTunes :(
Get a life dude.
&quot;Dead in the middle of little Italy&quot; ...nice Pun reference
As soon as this song ends, Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell immediately starts playing in my head. Goddamn I love this album.
ur gay
One of the few songs I can listen to daily and never get tired of. Good cheer up song, good chilling song, good &quot;Fuck you!&quot; song. very versatile and very underrated. Production is off the cervix too

Billy Joel
What do you mean &#39;if that&#39;s what it was&#39;? Why would it not be a song? Which part of your, obviously, wildly different definition of song does it not fit? You absolute fucking moron.
You should never argue with a crazy mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind
ta add good ish y&#39;all gotta a new sub
Check out my channel SUB,LIKE,DISLIKE,COMMENT SUBSCRIBE Acoustic Hip-Hop and Beats,
dang, he one-line-ethered you with a line from the song that this argument is taking place in the comments section of. and it totally applies. * high fives hipster riding by on DIY bicycle made entirely of neon wayfarer sunglasses *
Uhggg .. what an awful song, if thats what it was.
i love how i spent all the time to find out the first comment.. and of course it has to do with hipsters lol
Haha kanye.. Id believe it
Was this entire argument intentional leading up to this?
very good track dude!!
The Diplomats brought me here lol. Wow.
you get a thumbs down and a fuck off.
Probably because Anamaguchi did a remix of Das Racist&#39;s tune Rainbow in the Dark.
i googled that, got some interesting results
bily joel
How the hell did Anamanaguchi get me here? o_O
This will get ya swerve on
Bill Crosby would be a fan.
Dipset.
&quot;They called us joke rap, we kinda weed rap We just like rap, we don&#39;t even need rap Could get a real job, only rap weekly I don&#39;t need rap, told you, rap need me!&quot;
i can&#39;t stop listening to it ..
I did a remix of this song... check it out if you want.
This is gonna be useless and you guys will probably not believe me, but i smoked weed with kool a.d. when they performed at electric forest last year. Easily in the top 3 coolest things i&#39;ve ever done. Just thought i&#39;d share
I&#39;m fairly certain that carbonatedturd is actually Victor, engaging in performance art by instigating the stupidest possible internet argument within the comments of his own song.
pure shit. corny as fuck.
sampling the beginning
1:41 - I lol&#39;ed so hard &#39;cause you can tell he&#39;s patting his hand over his mouth while he&#39;s talking
You deserve so many more thumbs up it&#39;s fucking ridiculous.
this is all very silly.
billy joel - movin&#39; out
I spin round like a vinyl, all sales final
who did they sample here?
Billy Joel: movin out
What
you hipster you
their only good song
woah! forgot about this song!
R.I.P DAS RACIST
did he died?
gay
When did I get cornered? Here&#39;s a tip, douche canoe, when you start insulting strangers on the internet, be prepared to explain why. Saying &quot;lol&quot; just makes YOU look like an idiot, and despite the fact that I&#39;ve clearly asked why you disagree with my original statement, I&#39;ve gotten nothing but idiocy from you. Get ready to have your own personal troll, because the comments are just beginning, hipster fuck.
Oops, I almost forgot to point out YOUR name. What&#39;s that saying about idiot hipsters in glass houses not throwing stones?
So what you&#39;re saying is that you didn&#39;t understand the very valid point I made about hipsters, and you decided to call me an idiot without backing it up with anything. Either that or you&#39;re a hipster, in which case, go fuck yourself. Nobody likes you.
LOLOMGWTFBBQ!!!!1 If you&#39;re going to call someone an idiot, at least have a point, and try not to make yourself look like a 12 year old.
&quot;gruba baba&quot; :DDDDD
RIP Das Racist
So what you&#39;re saying is that you made a general statement about hipsters not being able to like this because it&#39;s good but because you want to sound cool over the internet so you tell people why people you consider hipsters like this music. Gotcha, virgin. cy@
I find it funny that you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about. In my first comment I said hipsters don&#39;t like music that&#39;s this good, and in my second comment I followed that up by saying that they only pretend to like it because it&#39;s not mainstream. How was that so difficult to understand? So to sum up. This is good music that hipsters only pretend to like.
I find it funny how the only two posts I see by you on this song are contradictory to each other.
wish they get back together
They&#39;re famous for nothing.
Can&#39;t stop listening to this.
you&#39;re such a dumbass. Do the world a favor and don&#39;t speak or reproduce. PLEASE.
Which film&#39;s soundtrack isit?
troof
Don&#39;t worry, they don&#39;t like it because it&#39;s good, they like it because it&#39;s not mainstream. Hipsters don&#39;t like music, they like the idea of telling you about music you haven&#39;t heard of, which is exactly why you have a bunch of hipsters eager to introduce this to you.
literally the whole group of people who introduced this song to me are hipsters
You want to elaborate on that? Do you think hipsters listen to shit this good?
fucking hipsters
Passionate MC did the same beat with the Wiz Kid Mcfly
damn shit&#39;s good
Very good song :)
One of my second favorite by this group of geniuses
Classic Mixtape. Song is so dope I couldn&#39;t help it.Check out my Channel to view.
What?
Click on show comment for the lyrics at the end of the song.
Wow, I never thought I&#39;d hear Billy Joel remixed. Das Racist killed it, though.

Billy Joel - Movin&#39; Out
@Dodoakakakadu The song is Movin&#39; Out by Billy Joel
Sum1 no the name of the Original Song?!
qwell im backed
They are so fucking stupid for breaking up
YouTubers waste too much time with elaborate hate posts. Just enjoy or do something productive.
I thought this would be an Alanis Morissette cover.
can&#39;t believe they broke up...
Wahhhhh COME BACK! How could you possibly split :&#39;( You oughta know... that be CRAY!
Every time I come to this video, I listen to the song twenty or thirty times in a row. I think I have a problem. I must be addicted to racism.
YOU SHOULD NEVER ARGUE WITH A CRAZY LALAALA UUHHH LALAOOOLALA

Damn this sucks :(
RIP DAS RACIST

That is in fact a lyric in the song.
&#39;Tired of arguing with white dudes on the internet&#39; OH FUCK YES I KNOW.
I&#39;ll never listen to Billy Joel the same way again.

You need to just reach that lower lever and it will slingshot you to hyperspace, prepare for a jolt &amp; brace, it gets pretty intense when you burst thru the stratosphere and travel so fast you go back in time, its that lower lever there, don&#39;t pull it if you don&#39;t want to go...just be careful dude ..

how do i spead it up using youtube?
nah november first dude
This song makes me feel like God touched me in my special places.
this joint needa be longer
thats the entire point of it.... If he cleaned it up, he would ruin it.
Speed it up x2 and laugh your ass off. Or that just might be because I&#39;m high.
Does Wild Water Kingdom still drop on the 15th?
Bittibi ba bababas clearly influenced by Arrested Development Everyday People.... Awesomeness.
you should never argue with a crazy babababababababababab you oughta know by now
This bangs.
that was the whole point. thats what made this song epic lol
Dope
Firme rola homie
sick of arguing wit white dudez on the Internet 0:38
it&#39;s the beat from you oughta know by juelz santana
Ultimate feel good tune.
hmm interesting ..
parts of this song are catchy and parts make me wanna press the back button like the chorus gets worse every time he says it and sometimes the rhyming just drops randomly and it sounds terrible but i think if the artist cleaned it up a bit it would be a great cover
You should never argue bah bah bung bung boo bah Oo bah zoo ba doo bee ou badda know right nowwww.
billy joel: movin out
Dipset killed this already but okay effort. It is their beat
Nah. Its a Dipset Instrumental.
THANK YOU
so does 420
yds
new artist added to my favorites....:D
True, I guess. You are *supposed* to give the source though at least, although that rule obviously isn&#39;t followed 100% of the time.
yea. das racist used dipset&#39;s sample.
but isnt tumblr knowm for copying and pasting ppls pics?
LOL , you should never argue with a crazy mamamamama
Yep. The Heatmakerz produced this beat..
Didn&#39;t Juelz Santana/Cam&#39;ron/Dipset first sample this track from Billy Joel?
This song+1.5x speed=fuckin Jam
You should never argue with a BINGBINGBINGBONGBONGBEEBOPBEEBOPBOOBOOBOOBOOBAHBAHBAH...
they didn&#39;t consciously use a &quot;Billy Joel sample.&quot; they just used the Fruity Loops music software. One of the sample packs has the billy joel sample pre-snipped. they didn&#39;t even change the pitch of the sample lol
fruity loops has changed the world
this song speaks to every white dude arguing on the internet.
Amazing song !!!!!

HE IS A FIGMENT OF THE MEDIA
BILLY JOEL DOESN&#39;T EXIST HE ISN&#39;T REAL
DAS RACIST IS BILLY JOEL
No shit this is Billy Joel. I grew up on Billy. I&#39;m not talking about the original song. I&#39;m talking about this sampled instrumental.
No shit. I&#39;m not talking about the original. I&#39;m talking about this sampled instrumental.
movin out&quot;
billy joel 1977
Nice job copy and pasting Heems&#39; Tumblr post. &gt;__________&gt;
It&#39;s a mixtape. Look up the definition.
I saw this when it had 5k views and because of that i feel as though i am better then others listening to it now and want some attention for it. I don&#39;t care about you its all about me so please give me some attention, thank you.
Dear kiddies, Movin&#39; Out was released by Billy Joel in 1977. Which is probably before any of those heatmaker people were born. So unless they have some magical time machine your claims that these folks made this &quot;beat&quot; is suspect.
the only good das racist song. the rest is hipster garbage
das racist
I didn&#39;t say I didn&#39;t like it, I just think the original is much better. I&#39;ve loved this beat for over 8 years, it&#39;s possibly the best beat The Heatmakerz ever made.
alright makes sense but if you don&#39;t like this song why did u comment on it? and watch it?
Who cares what someone from Iceland thinks..
It&#39;s not a lie you idiot. How is that a lie?? The Heatmakers did produce this beat. No shit this samples Billy Joel&#39;s Moving Out. That doesn&#39;t mean Billy Joel produced this beat. The Heatmakers did.
dude your right i don&#39;t know. I guess im not as underground as you
Just so you know they both sampled it from billy joel so saying the heatmakerz originally produced it is a lie nice try bro
i doubt half these ppl even know where that samples from -__-
hey dude nobody cares but you
I hope you guys know Cam&#39;ron &amp; Juelz Santana made a song over this beat 4 years before Das Racist even existed. The Heatmakerz originally produced this beat.
Cam&#39;ron &amp; Juelz &gt; Das Racist
Impossible.
Theese guys smoke waaaaaaaay to much :P
come on!! Why isn&#39;t this song on spotify??!
Deep Ass Shit samples America&#39;s Most Blunted
&lt;3
Where does it sample Madvillain?
O dont like this &quot;music&quot;
If more people would &quot;steal&quot; famous songs and make mixes like this the world would be a better place! The sound is very crazy and good to hear!
hahhahah.... but seriously: watch?v=li0qpQuPHfw
sample is from &quot;Billy Joel - Movin&#39; Out&quot;
&quot;sick of arguing with dudes on the internet&quot; lolz
480 gives an incredible difference in sound quality :p
why is this not on Itunes?
Want hip-hop? Want it how it should be, in it&#39;s purest form? Listen to anything from the rza or any of the 9 original members of wu tang clan besides ugod or master killa but especially rza, genius, ghostface, methodman or inspectah deck. SUUUUUUU
I weep for the future of mankind when people start making horrible, rip-off music stolen from &quot;the piano man&quot; &amp; speed it up to an annoying tempo before finally recording the whackest flows ever over it and laying down a hook of literal gibberish nonsense. People who gave this thumbs up... You should be ashamed. Didn&#39;t your mothers teach you any better?!
fav line
lol. 1st track of theirs i heard was Combination Pizza Hut &amp; Taco Bell. i didnt even like that nor find it particularly funny or entertaining. i still like that track better than Wiz Khalifa&#39;s rap existence. Das Racist&#39;s Who&#39;s That...Broooown &amp; Fake Patios are my favorites from these cats.
one of them is latino
Lmao diss so so funny dude
dirt bag dan sent me here
This is the first song I&#39;ve heard by them...and I already like them better than wiz khalifa
correction. You should never argue with a crazy mi mi mi mi mind
that bassline is quite bumpin
I was expecting more of a right-wing German group, with a name like that.
The original beat is BIlly Joel&#39;s Movin&#39; out its called sampling most artists do it.
Camron used this beat in like 03
This is a mixtape. It samples a lot of shit. The original is from Billy Joel. This tape also sampled Tribe, Bob Marley and Madvillain. It&#39;s not exactly a new thing, &quot;stealing&quot; beats.
cam&#39;ron stole this beat
i was bitten by a mosquito and my shirt is blue
sky blue? or is it a darker shade?
&quot;You should never argue with a milalawghjcfzdslkh&quot;
WHAHAHHA
este tema esta muy asperooo
you should never argue with wooaahhrbllblwawaraauyua
the best Das Racist song !
My socks are blue.
that, I agree with.
Youtube comments are as pointless as circlessssss
there&#39;s nothing wrong with it, but what&#39;s the point? it&#39;s as irrelevant as saying something like &quot;my socks are blue&quot;.
I like that one part where he&#39;s all: &quot;mmamaaaaauammasuuahmnmmmbmbmbbbmb youuaawwwannnoooobyyyyynaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuu&quot;!
this was recommended to me, seems pretty cool, i like it
yeah, dude, he&#39;s not trying to say that he&#39;s hipster and all, he probably means that Das Racist is getting popular! a couple thousand views to a million is a HUGE step!
Or maybe he just remembers? He didn&#39;t say &quot;I liked this before it was cool&quot; or anything. I remember when it was relatively unknown as well. Big deal?
the false intelligence is really irritating... and then you hear an actually good song by them... I&#39;m still not sold but i think there&#39;s some talent.
There pretty good

I&#39;M ADDICTED TO THIS BEAT, I already played this shit like over a dozen times already and I&#39;m still not tired of it yet. This group turned me into a fan from the first hearing, props to my Indian brothas for getting a taste of that success.

LMFAO

Lyrics: You should never argue with fsuefhsofhsewfhfhejfohsfo
its a douchey thing to say
OKAY OKAY
What&#39;s wrong with one mentioning knowing the song when it had less views? It&#39;s not like they&#39;re imposing elitist views on you...
Why, what about it.
dam wen i first came here there was only like 700 views
I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d like this....but it&#39;s pretty damn cool.
you should never argue with the crazy mamaamma you oughta know right now
what do you mean? lol
These dude are fucking sweet idk what it is about em .... prolly the dopeness
&quot;sich of arguing with white dudes on the internet&quot; das racist
Was gonna go to their concert two days ago in San Francisco, got flu. Wanted to die.

sir are you a hipster ?
I know !!!! Their popularity just exploded
Lol what would ppl think if I told them this was my fav song?
No prob Captain Obvious.
so it&#39;s not theft, then? thanks for coming out.
I just said a few comments down that it&#39;s theft unless it&#39;s a mixtape....dumdum
dude was just saying.... lol alot of cats think Das Racist were the first to use this sample...
yeah, they&#39;re rapping over other people&#39;s beats. it&#39;s called a mixtape, dumdum.
original is better. Movin&#39; Out (Anthony&#39;s Song) - billy joel
Which came first... Yelawolf&#39;s &quot;Everything I Love the Most&quot;, or this song?
This seems to have come out in 2010 whereas the Yelawolf song came out in 2011
@celisoog Isn&#39;t it exhausting to type like that?
Hocus Pocus - On and on ! CLASH!
lol
lalalala blalala lalalala :D
@datickywickygurl the original song is the best... Billy Joel
some of the best mumbling i have ever heard
Billy Joel is amazing in concert!
@SpennyPwns The fact is that he need to tell the world he listened to it, before is was cool. That&#39;s hipster enough for me. And even if that doesn&#39;t make sense I still won the argument as you used racist slang.
@lucaskrause14 you&#39;re such a hipster.
bopbopbopbpobpbpbpobopbpobpbobpbobppbob

8 von 10
@TheNywa billy joel- moving out, originally a beat made by cam&#39;ron and juelz santana
@stillnotlovinnpolice you guys are seriously arguing over youtube? lol some people have way too much pride to defend
@nerdsgethunk you hear JAW? send me a Message :D
@stillnotlovinnpolice in the 19th century a third of americas income was from manufacturing, slavery was dependent on northern manufacturing and so basically the fuel was manufacturing plants in the north due to the industrial revolution. thousands of europeans flocked to this region thus becoming employees in factories manufacturing goods that built the united states. without the north there wouldve been no south
Who know how sample was used in this beat ?
Sounds like Scatman John
@stillnotlovinnpolice ha what? that rant made no sense at all
CANT. STOP. LISTENING. TO. THIS. GODSEND. OF. A. SONG.
@wge621 not ust once proly abaut 50 times :D
@spiderman2044701 were from slovenia =)
@stillnotlovinnpolice im not white. i didnt make any commands whatsoever either. people should have more respect for whites though, without them, this nation would be nothing
@spiderman2044701 went to wesleyan where my brother went in middletown connecticut. hella good school they dont fit it at all lol
ya i saw u brian shared ur vid on face book u and ur friends r really good where r u from
@stillnotlovinnpolice WHY DIDNT I GET A NOTIFICATION FOR THIS COMMENT?!?!?!!!!!? AHHHHHHHHHHHHH SO MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADD!!!!!!!!!!!!! anybody can get away with anything when it comes to white people, leave them alone.
Have these guys made a song that isn&#39;t a complete rip off of someone else?
@stillnotlovinnpolice WHY ARE YOU BEING SO FUCKING RACIST?!?!?!?!???
@4EvaJDG but ofc :D im big fan off good free run videos i have 5 videos but they aint good as others :D videos are hard to make ;)
Brooklyn zoo!

i might only like it cuz the B.Joel sample!
@OGbobbyjohnson85 &gt;doesn&#39;t understand irony.
...did the beat no justice
I like to slow it down with a marijuana cigarette
@juandiego1234567890 Looks like they&#39;re getting pretty popular because of this song! It&#39;s amazing!
Honestly i dont mind them?
@stillnotlovinnpolice how is that funny?
This reminds me so much of Chiddy Bang. Which is a good thing.
lmao love them ... Amazinggg ;D
dope beat
Do White dudes on the internet smell like wet dog in after it rains Heems?
I used to fight internet haters...then i took an arrow to the knee.
@stillnotlovinnpolice Lol yeah all the racist comments on youtube!
this isn&#39;t racist, it&#39;s just shitty music. DAS GARBAGE
I think by this point we&#39;re all sick of arguing with white dudes, on the internet. Folks, calm down. It&#39;s just a song.
&quot;ALIENS&quot; :)
@metformin65 they make vastly more money than you and i - u mad? it&#39;s disturbing how lovable someone or something (like these guys, or justin bieber) become when they&#39;re inundated with hate. it&#39;s the opposite of what you wanted, isn&#39;t it?
THIS IS FUCKING AMAZING!!!! :D INDIAN STONER RAP!? FUCK YEA!!!!
pointless idiots. loathe these asswipes.
BILLY JOEL REPRESENT, NIGGA
@silverbeatle23 There sure is a lot of dumb going on below us, eh? Only idiots really think they know what happened and what is happening. Truth resist simplicity. (somehow the only simple truth I&#39;ve ever known) Just listen to the music guys... and keep your uneducated and ignorant comments in your own head. In 80 years, your existence will be a wash anyway.
all you guys argiong about polotics and history do that shit somewhere else. sompe people are actually trying to enjoy some good artistic music
@juandiego1234567890 Except for the fact that its not a band? /sigh
@stillnotlovinnpolice jay kay, dude. jay kay.
@stillnotlovinnpolice fuck libs. i outgrew my liberalism long ago, but i ain&#39;t no god-damn conservative, that&#39;s for sure. more of a &quot;libertarian.&quot; this way, you get free markets and a free mind.
@stillnotlovinnpolice fascist
WHITE DUDE ON THE INTERNET? Im one of them but I dont hate!
Dope!
these guys are cool and they suck at the same time.
@stillnotlovinnpolice I feel you about that, arguing about how can you act black?
@juandiego1234567890 hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

@FlyLife23kissMe They thought it was funny when people yelled out &quot;that&#39;s racist!&quot; in reaction to a situation. &quot;That&#39;s racist!&quot; later evolved to their name, Das Racist.

I am sick of arguing with white dudes on the internet
@rebreh1029 lol yeah those damn white dudes that run the world. and the one you work for.
@1in24 I mean 2nd, my bad
@1in24 Kool AD has the deeper voice, so the 1st guy is Heems
@chesire94 look at this guy, who thinks music has to fit a specific style to be good. HAH!
Ummm, I probably sound stupid, but which one is Heems? The one who raps first in this track or is it Kool AD? I can never tell.
earning, learning, yearning, discerning, vulture, culture, sculpture enough sir... this is not rap. You hurt music with this crap...
If you Listen to #Dope Music like this Peep my Page -Rhyme Scheme Reem #Swag!!

@rebreh1029 dude das racist fucking blows
shut up, dude.
I&#39;m white and i love Das Racist
Dipset did this better
@vladimirobamaosama what do u mean too bad?
The people that are complaining that &quot;Oh they stole this.&quot; Has never once listened to any hip hop ever. Because if they did they would know that its Called &quot;Sampling&quot; and even back in the day Hip Hop artists would sample. Sheesh. I can see if the album was for sale and they didn&#39;t give Jole his credit. Now that&#39;s stealing. But this is a &quot;MIXTAPE&quot; its FREE. So they can sample whatever the heck they want.
I don&#39;t argue. I make very valid statements, while dumb niggas respond
@xXRawrxImxThexDinoXx heems and ashok are indian
@Mooninite2021 BOOM, Good shit brah
@vicohen123 &quot;I like to slow it down with a marijuana cigarette (He likes to chill out and smoke)/ Occasionally with powders in it (Sometimes he&#39;ll sprinkle coke inside his blunt)/ Yes Talcum Fresh (What is also a white powdery substance? Talcum powder! That&#39;s right. Anyone would have assume cocaine, but sometimes we have to take things at more than face value). &quot;Leave a message on my phone/ I&#39;m only sort of home (You can talk to him, but sometimes he&#39;s lost in thought.) Was that so hard?
@vicohen123 It&#39;s called using metaphors... Are you new to hip-hop
@vladimirobamaosama too bad your muzik need racism
If you think these guys are talking nonsense, chances are you have no sense
indian, who cares?
Ushuiijfhiodhndfidaifudafuhafuoadhfhudah MAH MAH MAH YOU OUGHTA KNOW BY NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@vladimirobamaosama Actually the one with the beard is puerto rican.
even alanis morrissette is better than this tripe
Is it just me, or is 2:35 to 2:56 reminiscent of Borat&#39;s favorite song?
@teleman811 hey kid he was just repeating the first verse on the song
i fucken love these guys, you see this is what rap yoused to be back in the day, just funnin out gettin high with your homies and blasting this outta loud speakers 10+ love it

...Sick of arguing with white dudes on the internet.

A rich interior worlds a joy to own
Where did these guys come from? They just popped up outta nowhere
I am also sick with arguing with white dudes on the internet. Das Racist rules
@jacisherosick Hey Das Racist
Kto od Pod≈Çego ≈Çapa w g√≥rƒô! kma kma kma
This song is trash. The DIPSET! Version was better they are talking about nonsense.
@jacisherosick shut up, dude
Crazy song xd
@clevhaus You&#39;re kidding right?
@S2Cents clarify plz
Okay. &quot;Movin&#39; out&quot; is the original. Rappers Cam&#39;ron and Juelz Santana rapped on this beat way before Das Racist, like back in &#39;02. I wonder who made the beat.
hipster hop
ive seen um in concert there were so g
@harrisawan786 lets not go that far bud
@Vanderstein950 You&#39;re the one listening to it.
my sister &quot;what are you listening to?&quot; &quot;the sound of EVERYTHING&quot; &quot; it sounds like hipster rap...&quot; me&quot;whatever&quot;
You and your sis had some crazy times back then huh?
whats the name of the original song that plays right at the beginning?
@Vanderstein950 Facepalm, mostly all rap beats use samples from other works of music. It isn&#39;t stealing, it&#39;s called recycling art. If you don&#39;t like it don&#39;t listen to it.
Hey go watch the video for my song &quot;Lord.of.the.Flies&quot; it is one of the most bizarre, funny videos ever and will be to rap what punk was to rock.
@Vanderstein950 It&#39;s pretty obvious you do not have a clue about hip hop. Using the chorus of Moving On for a hook of their own is normal in hip hop or any other genre. Black Eyed Peas did it with Time of My Life. It&#39;s been done hundreds of time. Just do us a favor and keep your idiotic comments to yourself. You don&#39;t like the video? Don&#39;t watch it. NEEEEXT!!!
@tru3sound Serenade that shit, beyotch.
@vanderstein950 that&#39;s what rap is, idiot
Basically this song is poosacklol.
These two individuals took a Billy Joel Song (Moving Out) and used it&#39;s chorus, guitar riffs, rhythm, and practically everything the song contained and used it as the beat of there song (if you can call it a song). The only real aspect of originality is the lyrics, but then again used the chorus of the song as their own chorus. This is plagarism right in front of your face, basically, and it questinos my mind if these guys can do anything completely original that is not about chicken and meat.
If your about to bitch about sampling, hip hop is clearly not for you, move along silently
STFU AND PUFFPUFFPASS!
@ThePianoSerenade Also, the samples were obviously cleared by whoever has copyright over them. So not even Billy Joel gives a fuck. You&#39;re just a moron, have a nice day.
@ThePianoSerenade Is this the first hip-hop song you&#39;ve ever heard or is it the first one you were able to recognize the sample in? You&#39;re obviously not very well educated in music. I like Billy Joel, and I also like this song...of course people can hear the sample is from &quot;Movin&#39; Out&quot;---it&#39;s not even an obscure Joel song, they play it on classic rock radio stations at least 5x a day. Change your tampon and educate yourself on hip-hop music and sampling.
god damn...billy joel fans are really pisssed off about this....dope song
LOL love reading all the hate comments on this song. keep on hating haters, the artists will sleep well at night even with your lame ass hate coments. Keep it up Das Racist....love your work
@ThePianoSerenade We&#39;re not all Billy Joel fans.
Das Racist = Das Posers. Poorly sang, garbage rap and complete rip off of a Billy Joel song.
@thedatamoroe I don&#39;t think THEY sampled this. Heatmakerz sampled this for Dipset a long time ago. They just rapped over it.
Sampling? This is an entire rip off of a real song, made by someone who actually has talent.
my pre-drink jam.
you should balsdhahsdfakjneineiub feiwufhjewilunhfewifewbalablalbalablblal you oughta know by now.
Instrumental of this + headbob = CHILL
ali tomineek&#39;s version is so much better !
u guys fucking suck ass
We&#39;re educated enough to work the internet! Seriously, man! I&#39;m sick of arguing with white dudes on the internet!
click dislike and fuck off then
@ojloves it&#39;s ok to have bad taste
@ojontherocks that should be &quot;an uneducated fuck&quot;, but you knew that right?!
@thesoundoffear85 hahaha no. you are a uneducated dumb fuck. have a nice day :)
@ojloves I think it&#39;s great; I&#39;m well educated thank you. Maybe your one of those stupid people who thinks videos about nail marbling are interesting and that if someone&#39;s tastes are different to yours then they are &#39;uneducated dumb fucks&#39;?!
this is the worst fucking piece of shit song i&#39;ve ever heard in my life. if you like this song, you&#39;re an uneducated dumb fuck.
odd future has nothing on das racist
the irony of the two top comments... :/
I think he was hitting the bong while trying to sing the hook...
@MrLunchbox829 grumble grumble yeah thats right
no arguing with white dudes in these comments!
0:30 sounds like gucci mane haha
@Rynoceros007 alright thanx bro gudd to know
these guys are finally dropping a new album i think this year anybody hear about this?
The people think their raps actually suck; I think they&#39;re only paying attention the the chorus, which isn&#39;t meant to be lyrically fluent. Listen to their raps; they go hard as fuck.
* They&#39;re
They DOnt Suck! Their good!
not racist... but they suck lol
@GatoradeCrash it&#39;s moving out by billy joel
FUCK YOU this is all i ever hear now. GOD DAMNIT
some people may think their lyrics are just blabbering words but its not. it&#39;s way beyond anything most rappers have said and on the level of the greatest lyricists in the world.
you..should...neva argue with you..crazy moma nanananlalal you oughta know by now.....
@RaygunShaun OH SHIT MAN...I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT THAT SHOW. gonna go watch it now.
these guys are the fin best
@galexiamoon das racist
what song is this sampled from?
I wish these dudes would get on Amazon.com.... I wanna buy this on my phone...
@jofstar its a mixtape so they use other peoples beats and then just rap to it
The fact that this group named themselves after something they saw on Wonder Showzen automatically makes them my favorite people ever.
@kanagawa85 HAHAHAHAHAHA, good one!
Is this a freestyle? It just sounds exactly the same as the beat from oughta know by dipset
@mcjack11 or do you............................
@olivs93 ... I don&#39;t...
@mcjack11 or do you..........
@hailsatan666abortion ??? that really doesn&#39;t prove anything. I know how to spell Ferrari, I know how to spell a million dollars, I know how to spell caviar, and I don&#39;t have any of those.
@hailsatan666abortion Yeah, if you spelled it right... I don&#39;t have a fleshlight, and that&#39;s not how you spell that either. Come on, we learned how to spell light in kindergarten.
@hailsatan666abortion oh shit! He&#39;s up in dat voodoo! Okay, I typed in Vadge in google, and found a musician. Spell better!
@hailsatan666abortion oh shit! It&#39;s gettin serious! foot fetishes!
Does anyone else feel like this song is just making fun of gym class heros?
I don&#39;t like all these hate comments when i&#39;m trying to listen to das racist. this song is so chill so why all the rage.

dope style.
I can&#39;t take these guys seriously, and I think they don&#39;t take themselves seriously, that&#39;s why I like them. I don&#39;t even listen to rap/hip-hop music. This is good stuff. :]
YO! Please search &quot;Medz See You Later&quot; and LIKE my music video--I&#39;m tryna win a contest! PEACE!
&quot;get in the middle-a little-a&quot; Big Pun reference?
@andrewmcwatters WHO ARE THESE BROWN MEN SHITTING IN THE TEMPLE OF MUSIC?! Nobody is droning out &quot;real music&quot; and as far as &quot;real music&quot; is concerned they write some of the most intelligent, witty, and socially analytical lyrics I&#39;ve ever heard.
fuck yeah, makes me happy that old school hiphop is still being made feels good &lt;:)
Sick song. Also- lol @ people that argue on the internet. XD

@EsplinGonzalez you definitely puff sausage
Sick of arguing with crazy white dudes on the internet
@bucket415 I think you pointed out how fucking stupid you are by reading the first few pages of comments on a youtube video, dumbass.
@bucket415 For christs sake goddamnit.
@n00bBalance ahaha. Perfect yeah
@EltJohn I viewed and listened based on a recommendation. I then read the first few pages of comments. I noticed an argument over who&#39;s &quot;beat&quot; this was. When Billy Joel wasn&#39;t mentioned, I thought I&#39;d point out how fucking stupid all of you are.

@TheCash311 Its just the way the colors are patterned to unfolded cubes. Gives it a cool feel and another dimension to it that&#39;s just subtle but cool.
@GoldenChildBH I&#39;d contest this but I&#39;m sick of arguing with white dudes on the internet
@GoldenChildBH I&#39;d contest this but I&#39;m sick of arguing with white dudes on the internet

Best bassline ever created
Did anybody notice the subtle art in the color and shape pattern they put into their name on the cover? Look at it for a while, you&#39;ll see it.

&quot;You should ba-ba-ba-ba-be-ba-be-ba-ba-ba-bu-bo-ba-ba, you should ba-ba-ba-be-ba, you should ba-ba-ba-be-ba, you should ba-ba-ba-ba-be-ba-biddy-ba-ba-ba-biddy-ba-ba-ba-bing-bing-bing-bing-bahng-bahng-bahng-bahng-biddy-ba-ba-ba-be-bay-ba-ba... biddy-ba-ba-BA... biddy-ba-ba-ba, biddy-ba-ba-ba-bing-bing-bing-biddy-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-be-da... biddy-ba-ba-BA... biddy-ba-ba-ba, biddy-ba-ba-ba-bing-bahng-ba-ba-bing-bahng-bing-bang&quot; Best lyrics ever.

@nstoner111 fuck you and your stupid HipHop rules and shits. if you don&#39;t like it just get the fuck out. you&#39;re not criticizing for a fuckin journal, no one gives a fuck about your opinion, no. one... fuck. off.

Best song ever... ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.
@SethllRandom That&#39;s because this is hip hop. These guys take it back to the roots. Like everything else in the USA, it get&#39;s twisted by pop culture and turns into that cars and money crap played on the radio. These guys are legit, like it was meant to be when created way back when.
this is a pretty good song...im starting to like these guys...
Hi im an artist from the uk ive made hot! material 4 2011 and i wud appreciate if u took a couple min n stopped by on my channel to hear me out &quot;its the kingpin&quot;
@countchunkula Smart to just take the L.
@ghostie7790 Das Racist, read the title
who are these guys?
hahalol
@sce99257 FUCK OFF!
@coldchillin456 I&#39;m sick of arguing with white dudes on the internet.
@coldchillin456 you tight man jadakiss don&#39;t know you, you hype to be a supporter, you love helping people make money, where&#39;s jadakiss now... hahahahahaha you take life to literal man
co za asy...
Billy Joel&#39;s voice sounds really goofy sped up. Then again, most people sound goofy when you speed up their voices...
I went to sleep with this song stuck in my head last night thinking about how stupid I thought Das Racist was. Now I can&#39;t stop fucking listening to it.
Dipset beat, Cam&#39;ron and Juelz U Oughtta Know
@rsk06 it means that&#39;s racist... sike iono
@myothercariseva01 fuck you
@abel199012 Do your research, Jadakiss&#39; record he dropped last year sold over 500,000 records. But I&#39;ll let you hipsters live in your own fantasy world where complete trash like this record is considered dope.
@coldchillin456 WUt Jadakiss?! Lol when was the last time Jada even did anything? these guys are going to the woodies and where jada going to be? prolly his broken down apartment on the east side because he didnt make shit when he made records!
@USarmyB2 a jewish guy, dominican guy ,and indian guy = muslim?!?!?
Underground nerds will hype up the wackest shit... I&#39;ll pass after listening to this and go back to bumping the real rhymers like Jadakiss and Slaughterhouse. I should have known better when Spin and it&#39;s terrible magazine hyped this group.
@ricarto2k2 it&#39;s like a portrait of what it means to be crazy in our society. message less direct than normal hip hop. requires thought and subtle understanding. and yes, the tune is great.
yush i luv this song.
@wellherropreez but it pisses me off when people with biased opinions talk down about the diplomats version for whatever reason, but praise this version. i just don&#39;t understand
everyone only likes this version because they&#39;re not black
great tune but they aren&#39;t really saying shit. what&#39;s the message???
The Movin Out beat is crazy, Billy joel would be proud
@axwapples of course you can daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawg
@piazzajordan2: but of course! great sample from billy joel, everyone wins
@sephiroth1018 dude you are so cool man. can i subscribe to your newsletter?
so dope there like the new beastie boys
wow almost 500,000 views. i remember seeing this shit like a few months ago with barely 5000...
bamboozle ;O
fucking sick song.
Leave a message on my phone, I&#39;m only sort of home, the rest of me is sort of in the zone where the dodos roam.
@TVNIMI Same here.
&quot;I drink! I think! I chew one blue, two pink!&quot; GASSER!
studion9ne sent meh &lt;3
@suitmypants seriously? That&#39;s like half the fun!
Who would have thought 2 jews and an indian would&#39;ve made such a swag band.
THE INDIAN DUDE IN THE MIDDLE IS AMAZING
@suitmypants dipsets version is mad good
Itunes dont fail me now.
was this made before or after the juelz santana version?
haha luv it!!!!!!!
hahahahah awesome
This makes me feel how I felt the first time I listened to a hip-hop album I really loved. When I first got into it. The excitement. GOTDAMN!! DAS RACIST I WILL HAVE YOUR BABIES.

@TheCapetown123 Sorry i wasn&#39;t familiar with the tune. stfu.

@ackapollo theres more to KRSONE and his message then a few quotes

Completely ill.
@ackapollo go listen to KRS-ONE, he might teach you some lessons..bye
@ackapollo and no i dont just listen to &quot;lyrical emcees&quot;,i listen to many artists,i didnt say these guys are bad,i just said i don&#39;t consider these guys Hip Hop..adjust your ears,they may fit into a sub genre,but thats about it..LOL at you getting all emotional n saying you &quot;OWNED &quot; me..lol fucking geek.
@jcfelony13 beats*
@ackapollo so because the ebats sampled this is hip hop?and because they rapping on it with style flow and originality this is hip hop? lol listen to yourself,you really have no idea and your the type of person who never will understand or is gonna take years more for you to understand the true meaning.
@ackapollo when did i say that?hip hop does change yes,but this isnt hip hop in its pure form..nmore like..Pop Hop,Pop Rap..Hipster rap..haha..fuck outta here kid.
@ackapollo @nstoner111 this may be hip hop but it still sucks! i dont like paz cause he makes me want to kill people i like paz because his lyrics contain raw emotion, TRUE SELF EXPRESSION. its all subjective though, good music to me is shit to others. so i hope you fall 10 ft off your high horse and have to relearn your taste in music all over again you cocky, ignorant, close minded moron.
@jedah1985 please tell me the songgg..
@SuperElm He was talking about this song getting alot of views.. lol..
@swingAE86 i disagree,whats hip hop to you?,for some lessons on what real hip hop is ,watch a few videos/songs by KRS-One ..This isn&#39;t hip hop...sorry...
@nstoner111 Hell with you man. Hipsters did one thing right. they made hip hop GOOD again. go back back to listening to rick ross rapping about the last King mag girl he fucked
@raymoney07 its from juelz santana first album... track with cam
amazing.
who&#39;s the rapper who first got on this sample?? I think it was Kanye west..who was it? nd what song was it?
Billy Joel &quot;Movin Out&quot; is the cut, sample, etc. Das Racist is da shit and I will see em atSXSW yes! Me FTW!
I could hear this shit 24/7!
knew them since the beginning .. fantastic music !
raped the replay button!!
Yes.
@DamnYourUgly Yeah theyre from brooklyn. Same place where the greatest rapper of all time was from but im sure i dont need to give his name cuz yall know him
Wut. How have I not heard this before? Such greatness should be hidden from no man. Wut.
something uhh
The song that they sampled: Billy Joel - Movin&#39; Out
&quot;dead in the middle of little Idli, sambar, dosa&quot; genius
Refreshing to hear people having fun with Hip Hop again.
this song is sick! :)
Anyone know what this sample is from? Sounds very nice..
They where just in detroit they are some bad ass guys they let my friends an i hang on stage for their set and brought us with them to the green room Das Racist ftw
&quot;dead in the middle of little Italy&quot; - big pun
cant stop listening to this! so parusting!
best hook of ALL time ;) this shit is dope
shut up, dude. sit down, man.
@saladshootavvv sick of arguing with white dudes on the internet
Thank God. GOOD rap. Took long enough to come out, but... wow.
It&#39;s artists like these that give me hope for the music industry, pure self expression rather than auto-tuned &quot;street&quot; thugz or whatever they decide to call themselves
Such a good song. They play it sometimes on Sirius XMU and I love it every time.
I&#39;ve been listening to this all morning on repeat. That can&#39;t be healthy lol
this is good stuff. keep it up.
i likeeeeeeeeeeeeee
@anothercountyheard Thanks Dawg!
What is the song sampled in this song? I love this!
lol, the best thing about das racist is that they make you laugh and the music is so good, great combination, and rare
@saladshootavvv Idiot or a troll? All the same, get off the internet.
haha, its billy joel - movin&#39; out. you gotta know old music to know new music. sweet song DR.
@saladshootavvv what a prententious jackass you are, braying your shit on the internet.
Why`s this song blowing up all of a sudden? Soooo last year. . . But constructively I wanted to say that all the argument about ripping off Joel is moot; they ripped off a Heatmakerz beat that Santana and Cam`ron went in on years ago. Track`s on youtube, also called You Oughta Know. Like this one better though.
you&#39;re not Mexican?
thats cool how they used the billy joel sample
funny, clever. good stuff.
lol @ the sample. good stuff.
@dizzyfro it&#39;s called sampling, and a lot of hip hop artists do that. get with the program already. But you&#39;re right about Billy Joel being a legend.
he bit a big pun line lol
INDIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
@MAGGiiE69 so do vacuum cleaners, but I&#39;d rather listen to these guys than a damn vacuum cleaner
Nah, Billy Joel better. create something guys.
@JIAOHH DAS RACIST!!!
Easily one of the best songs of 2010; already made memories of summer, long drives and this tune. Boom selection, you oughta know.
@bkholmes79 and who exactly are you suposed to be that you think anyone wants to talk to you?
everyone shut up this songing is fucking awesome if you dont like it leave! thankssssssss &lt;3
It&#39;s like if Rancid was a rap group.
@saladshootavvv u sound like one of those nerdy band kids, prolly played the tuba and never got any in highschool, so now you troll people that like decent music and tell them to listen to your shit....go play in a recital and get your ass kicked geek....
16 people don&#39;t know.
@OSWNOSWNOSWN You forgot Peruvian beanies, Keen shoes, knowing about that band 6 months before you did, ironic mustaches, Saddle Creek Records, driving a Prius, Starbucks is too corporate to be seen at, iPads, microbrews, and arguing art on youtube.
@saladshootavvv But in the end, you are comparing apples and oranges. Music, in large part, is a reflection of the rise/decline of society. It mirrors the trends, events, and significant points of our modern lives. If you listen to music from the 17 and 18th century, then you are hearing the soundtrack to their lives. But why in the world would you go so far as to invalidate modern music by calling it shallow? Are our lives shallow as well?
@saladshootavvv Look, arguing about music is a pretty ridiculous activity. Music is just as objective as art, and in fact, to refer to classical music as &quot;art music&quot; is just about as limiting as it gets. By definition, ALL music is art, expression. Listening to classical is not like learning another language; it&#39;s the difference between listening and HEARING that takes practice. Sure, you can play the sophisticate and listen to nothing but classical all day and pretend you are enlightened.
@saladshootavvv im one of the musically illiterate kids your talking about. I think your argument is pretty limited and narrow minded. One of the beautiful things about music is its broad spectrum sure Beethoven and Stravinsky are great for some but they dont appeal to me so i can find other fantastic, intelligent and creative music in other genres like hip hop, rock or electronica. I cant think of a better way to turn my peers off exploring music than forcing them to listen to classical
yo.! im liking dis, i just got hip 2 dese dudes..! there quite nice..!! big upps.! :)
@SjokkoladeBolleMusa yeah i found it lol thanks
@CoolLarkin It&#39;s called ... THE INTERNEEEET ! Here you can find much different, from mp3 download web sites to pedophile forums... Enjoy ;D
@saladshootavvv i like all the things you&#39;re sick of, so i guess it all works out doesn&#39;t it?
where can i download this?
what the hell are these dudes talking about???
@saladshootavvv Coming from a guy whose upload page consists of some pretty uninspiring piano and a sweater wearing dog next to a swimming pool.....I&#39;d say you&#39;re on of the last people who should be critiquing music, style and what people appreciate.
@xerocada1 thank youuuu!!
@saladshootavvv explain to me how you came across this song
@saladshootavvv I&#39;d be willing to bet this guy wrote out his comment on an iphone, at a local foods symposium while wearing black frame glasses, cut off jeans, and keds. but, seriously guys, he hates those hipsters who give graphic design artists like him a bad name.
@saladshootavvv you forgot thick rimmed glasses, tight jeans and plaid shirts. otherwise i think your set.
@saladshootavvv no. it just makes me wrong.
@saladshootavvv Composeur.
@saladshootavvv oh yeah. and they&#39;re smart. they graaduated from wesleyan. you, my friend, probably aren&#39;t even in college.
everybody calm down and shut the fuck up.
@saladshootavvv Sick of hipster haters labeling the bands i like. Let it be breh
@saladshootavvv Sick of mainstreamers...
oh well who cares if there hipsters, i love it!!! get over it!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha. I love them!!!!!!!!!
dipset version goes harder... this is good too tho
I am responsible for 227,890 of the listens
@saladshootavvv vegans and organic food, art school, dropping out of art school, living in a loft, going to shows then folding your arms and then shaking your head, criticizing that show, blogging about that show, hating other hipsters, not knowing you are a hipster. Anything Else?
@rrrife moving out (anthony&#39;s song) by bill joel
can i buy this cd? mixtape whatever...
Their style&#39;s so fucking unique, I can&#39;t get over it xD I love it
@Ikhoordejijbenteng The Heatmakerz
12 people don&#39;t like this. They&#39;re probably def : /
@BEmagiK shut up, dude. sit down, man. don&#39;t worry im just playin&#39;
Man I love the background chorus, would&#39;ve actually been better without the rap.
this song is so fucking good.
@c0rruptl0l go hug him now!
how long have they been around ?/
Nice to hear there are still some MCs having FUN in hip hop. I am so sick of gangsta shit!
Anyone know what the sampled tune is at the start? Cause its hella tight
AHHHAHAHAHAHHALALALALALALALALALALDADADADADADADAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHALALALALALALADADADADA
i know the guy that made this beat!!
White dudes arguing on the internet below this line
@BEmagiK I think its time for you to go back to your Dave Matthews and Little Wayne videos. You are a sad, sad person.
@brizzwizz People, Residents call it East New York, I spent 4 years of my life there. An yes get angry and defend yourself over youtube. If you&#39;re not a hipster then calm down douche, my sarcasm and critique wasnt aimed at some person who considers being intelligent calling a part of bk &quot;East Bk&quot;. An who the fcuk says stompin grounds ? are you real ? lmao christ.
@BEmagiK I was just laughing at you saying not just saying East bk. I spend a little time there twice a week, I know all about the area. I&#39;m not even talking down on it, it&#39;s actually pretty good by me. And I truly doubt you&#39;d say a word to me, but keep thuggin and huggin sweetie
@BEmagiK Na, just picking on your dumbass for not just saying East bk. I know what the fuck the areas about, I actually spend a little time there twice a week. . I&#39;m not from the area, nor am I a hipster, but I would probably bust your ass if you ever &quot;called me out&quot;. That doesn&#39;t happen from my stompin&#39; grounds bud...Keep thuggin and huggin sweetie
@brizzwizz Last Stop on the L train buddy enjoy it, I actually call you hipsters out everytime i see some of you .. fun fun fun.
@BEmagiK East New York Brooklyn? baahahha, kooook
@djfakt like the name says &quot;shut up, dude&quot;
there guys are sick .. why not enjoy good production and guys from myc who have lived elsehwere
ill give this hipsters a pass they r hilarious, besides that fuck all of u williamsburg poison spoiled rich white kids .. Move to East New York brooklyn an catch a buck 50 lol Gentrification is sick
@djfakt So who are you blaming... white people who listen to music? lol
@guttergoldmusic how?

This is hilarious xD
at 2:33 he starts speakin his native tonuge... sounds like jibberish, but they kno
@Sarah8Salah Brooklyn, NY
babdabddadadbabababadabmeebdada
wtf
Food for animals reference at 2:08?
@djfakt das racist.
@djfakt The same way that gangsta rap &quot;co-opted&quot; hip hop music from groups like the Sugarhill Gang, De La Soul, and Run DMC? There has always been thoughtful rappers who talk about things besides the well-treaded subjects like living in the ghetto.
9 people clicked dislike by accident
@djfakt im sure you know so much about the streets... only supa fly gangstas say things like &quot;wankers&quot; and &quot;super-liberal&quot;
@djfakt B&#39;AWWWWW :&#39;(
@djfakt I love how you&#39;ve commented on all these videos trying to get people to listen to your opinion. if you want people to listen to your bullshit ideas then write them on your suicide note.
@djfakt nah man, you got it all wrong; raps about &quot;the streets&quot; is why rap is dying. its all becoming cliched as shit and boring; BronzDano put it best so go read his comment
Shits Funky!
This Song is the shit!! Das Racist is EXACTLY what hip hop needs! artist being themselfs bending the genre around their taste and not the other way around. Not everyone makin hip hop has to rap about flashy cars and easy women. social cometary was always a staple in true hip hop, and when is¬¥t comes to that not to many artist are even remotly close to these cats.
Unfortunately for these clowns, the ONLY people who listen to this bullshit are WHITE PEOPLE... This is EXACTLY why rap is dying...It&#39;s being takin&#39; over by a bunch of super-liberal, college educated wankers who know NOTHING about the streets...It happened to jazz and now it&#39;s happening to hip hop... This is some bullshit right here.
this is just hiphop - of a great kind
:&#39;)
The fact that they&#39;re capable of lyrics on this level yet chose to make waves on the back of a song about the unholy union of two fast food restaurants is either brilliant or hilariously self destructive
@Title27GT notice how i corrected myself
sickkk
@TheSparkrocka NO BILLY JOEL
@TheSparkrocka oh yeah billy joel! haha
elton john!
@youwise8D I don&#39;t hear it...

The singer kinda sounds like Jay Z but anyway awesome song!
fucking brillianttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
dope
sooo fucking good.
Really like this one
One thing is sure, in America the big money elites who rule America play the racism card as much as possible, falsely accusing anyone and everyone of being racist. The answer to which, these elites claim, is to let these elites rule over everyone (to stamp out racism).
